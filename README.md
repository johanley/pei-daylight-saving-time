### *Once Upon a Standard Time*
The article *"Once Upon a Standard Time"*, Wayne E. MacKinnon, Island Magazine, Number 1, Fall-Winter 1976, page 14.

I know of two inaccuracies in this article. 
He mentions ADT during WWII, but neglects to mention it during WWI (1918, 1919).
It could be seen as misleading to state that 1960 was the turning point. 
It's true that 1960 had ADT, but 1961 and 1962 did not, since there are no related orders-in-council for those years.
The modern, unbroken series of years with ADT actually started in 1963.

|1889|Change from Charlottetown Time to AST|52nd Victoria, Chapter 11, Page 50.|
|1918|ADT, matching Summer Time Act of Canada|8 George V, Chapter 2|
|1919|ADT for Public Offices, Mar 31 - Nov 1|9-10 George V, Chapter 9|
|WWII?|?|?|
|1947|AST. Provision for ADT, but not used until 1960|Chapter 39, Page 209|
|1956|AST. Can withhold grants to non-complying towns|Chapter 42, Page 109|
|1960|ADT. June 25 to September 30|Order-in-council|

|1995|ADT. First Sunday in April, last Sunday in October|Chapter 41, Page 1|

I believe that from 1947 to 1994 inclusive an Order-in-council was needed to apply ADT
explicitly in each year (if Executive Council decided to do so).

After that, the statute explicitly applied to both for current and future years.


## Statues (Acts) and Orders-in-Council

In the early years, statutes were identified by the year of the reign of the British monarch.
For example, `52nd Victoria` refers to the 52nd year of the reign of Queen Victoria.

Note also that statutes get periodically consolidated (1951, 1974, 1988, ...), such that various changes get amalgamated into "one place".
You may see references to such consolidations.

### 1889 
* 52nd Victoria, Chapter 11, Page 50.
* Assented 1889-04-17.

* *31st day of March and the 1st day of November, the time in the Provincial Public Offices shall be one hour in advance of the time as fixed by the Statute 52 Vic., Cap. 11, Sec. 1.*

### 1947
* Chapter 39, Page 209
* Assented 1947-04-25.
* *The Uniformity of Time Act*
* *An Act ot Provide for the Uniformity of Time Throughout the Province*
* "Daylight Saving Time". Refers to the "Standard Time" of Act 3 George VI, Chapter 23, which is the Interpretation Act of 1939: 
   *a reference to Atlantic Standard Time (sixty degrees west longitude) being twelve minutes and
   twenty-nine seconds fast of the local time of the meredian [sic] which passes through the Provincial Clock
   on the Law Courts building in Charlottetown.*
* Section 4 provides for ADT, using an Order in Council

### 1956
* Chapter 42, Page 109
* Assented 1956-03-29
* *An Act to Amend The Time Uniformity Act*
* *1. There shall be one uniform time in use throughout Prince Edward Island which shall be Atlantic Standard Time except as hereinafter provided.*
* *4. If the governing authority af any city, town or village declares any time effective 
within its corporate limits other than the time in force under this Act, the Lieutenant-Governor-

### 1960
* Order-in-Council to implement ADT.
* Date of order: 1960-05-05.
*  *Under authority of Section 3 of the Time Uniformity Act (R.S.P.E.I. 1951, Chapter 161) Council

  be observed in and throughout the Province of Prince Edward Island from Midnight on the 25th day 
  of June 1960 to Midnight on the 30th day of September 1960 during which period, in conformity 
  with said Section 3, such time shall be deemed to be the official time in the Province.*
* ADT midnight Saturday June 25 to midnight Friday September 30.

As far as I can see, both 1961 and 1962 have no corresponding order-in-council on the microfilm at the Public Archives.

* Date of order: 1963-04-10.

  of April, 1963 to Midnight on the 26th day of October, 1963 during which period, in conformity 
  with said Section 3, such time shall be deemed to be the official time in the Province.*
* the two dates mentioned are Saturdays
  
This was the beginning of the full, continual adoption of ADT in modern times. 
  Modern adoption started in 1963, from midnight Apr 27 (Sat) to midnight Oct 26 (Sat).
  Last Saturday in April until last Saturday in October (change at midnight).
  Announcement from the Deputy Provincial Secretary, in the 
  Guardian of April 27, 1963, page 13.
  Guardian of April 11, 1963, page 1 has an article stating that ADT will be implemented 
  for the first time since 1947:  ("fast time")
    "During the past few years, while other provinces were on advance time, this province had a form of 
    Daylight Saving Time, called 'advanced summer hours'. The government took the lead by opening and closing 
    its offices an hour earlier during the six months Daylight Saving Time was in effect in other parts of the country."
  1965: midnight April 24 (Sat) to midnight October 30 (Sat) (Guardian Apr 24, 1965)
